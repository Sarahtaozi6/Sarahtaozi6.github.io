# Supermarket Fresh Food CV — Web Tutorial (GitHub Pages Starter)

This repository is a starter template that already satisfies the course rubric structure:
- **Format & Ease of Use**: Multi-page HTML/CSS site, fast, responsive, accessible.
- **Mixed-Media**: 5+ image placeholders, audio element per page (replace with your voice).
- **Organization**: Clear navigation; landing page outlines path (15–30 min).
- **Originality**: Replace placeholder copy with your own writing and add citations.
- **Length**: Suggested time budget per section totals 15–30 minutes.
- **Grammar**: Please proofread before submission.
- **Level of Detail**: Methods page includes algorithm snippets; add your data/metrics and comparisons.
- **Interactivity**: Quiz page with instant feedback.
- **Annotated Bibliography**: Linked Bibliography with per-entry synopsis & reliability.
- **Presentation**: A PPTX skeleton is included in this zip (see /slides).

## How to use
1. Edit the HTML pages with your content. Replace image placeholders in `assets/img/` and the audio with your voice in `assets/audio/`.
2. Add citations like `[<a href="bibliography.html#ref-2">2</a>]` where appropriate.
3. Commit to a GitHub repo named `<yourname>.github.io` (or enable Pages in repo settings).
4. In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Build from `main` branch / root.
5. Wait a couple minutes, then open `https://<yourname>.github.io`.

## Voice-over
Record short MP3/WAV tracks (one per page), name them (e.g., `index.wav`, `datasets.wav`), and update the `<audio>` `src` on each page.

## Performance
- Images are lazy-loaded; keep them under ~200–400 KB.
- Use SVG/PNG for diagrams.
- Minify if needed.
